**New Findings:**

- The environments of severe thunderstorms over the plains, compared with those over the mountains, are generally characterized by stronger instability, more moisture, and higher vertical wind shear.
- Over both mountains and plains, the precipitable water (PW) shows the greatest skill overall in discriminating between various categories.
- Probability distributions in two-parameter spaces reveal that great variations exist regarding the environments under which different weather types are most likely to occur.

**Abstract:**

- During mid-July 2021, an extreme heavy rainfall event (HRE) occurred in Henan Province (hereafter “21.7” HRE), with extreme hourly precipitation of 201.9 mm appearing at Zhengzhou station. Our preliminary analyses of the “21.7” HRE using the observations and ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) ERA5 reanalysis data, reached the following conclusions. Favorable configurations of various synoptic weather systems (e.g., strong upper-level high-pressure ridge, intense middle-level low-pressure trough) acted as crucial background conditions for the occurrence of the “21.7” HRE. A 21-h long-lived mesoscale convective vortex (MCV), mainly located in the middle and lower troposphere west of Zhengzhou city, was a key system that produced the extreme hourly rainfall of 201.9 mmh1. The MCV's development/sustainment was dominated by the vertical transport of cyclonic vorticity and tilting, as well as the horizontal import of cyclonic vorticity to the vortex's key region. In contrast, the divergence-related vertical shrinking was the most detrimental factor. Lagrangian moisture transport analysis showed that moisture for the extreme heavy rainfall in Zhengzhou on July 20 mainly came from levels below 2200 m, driven by airflows on the peripheries of tropical cyclones IN-FA and CEMPAKA. To enhance the understanding of “21.7” HRE, we suggest more in-depth investigations in the future.
